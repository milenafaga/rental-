Rockbuster Stealth SQL Analysis
Project Summary
This repository contains an in-depth SQL-based analysis of Rockbuster Stealth’s business data, aimed at providing data-driven insights for the company's 2020 strategy. The analysis answers key business questions, including:

Which movies generated the most or least revenue?
What is the average rental duration for all videos?
Where are Rockbuster’s customers located?
Which regions have high-value customers?
How do sales figures vary across different geographic regions?
